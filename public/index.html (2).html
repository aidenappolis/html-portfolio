 <h3>The Wolf of Wall Street</h3>
 <p>Really one of the best movies I've watched, I wish I could watch it for the first time over again. It was a really cool movie.</p>
 <h3>Need For Speed</h3>
 <p>I enjoyed this movie as I have a passion for cars, It also captured the never say die attitude even when things aren't in your favour.</p>
 <h3>Scarface</h3>
 <p>This was a recent watch that I really enjoyed, It showcased everything, ambition, greed and power.</p>
